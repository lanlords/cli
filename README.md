# Lanlords CLI

CLI to easily and quickly manage the Lanlords infrastructure from your trusted terminal.
Beware that this CLI is extremely specific to the Lanlords infrastructure and
communicates with internal Lanlords systems which may not public.

## Development

When developing locally it's recommended to use a virtual environment. You can
create one like this:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
And then activate the virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
